## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer specializing in **real-time infrastructure**, **distributed systems**, and **high-performance backends**. I focus on building systems that are **production-ready from day one**—not just proofs of concept.

```go
type Engineer struct {
    Focus      []string{"Real-time Systems", "Backend Infrastructure", "Distributed Apps"}
    Philosophy string("Production-first, architecture-driven, performance-conscious")
    OpenSource bool(true)
}
```

- 💻 Full-stack & systems engineer with production deployment experience
- 🌍 Open-source advocate building tools for the community
- 🚀 Passionate about **clean architecture**, **scalability**, and **observability**
- 🧠 Designing systems that handle real-world load and complexity

## 💡 Design Philosophy

I build software guided by these principles:

```
🎯 Production-First
   └─ Every line of code should be deployable to real users

🧩 Clean Architecture
   └─ Maintainable, testable, and understandable by others

⚡ Performance Matters
   └─ Measure everything, optimize what counts

🌍 Open Source
   └─ Share knowledge, build in public, lift others up

🔒 Security by Design
   └─ Authentication, authorization, and encryption from day one
```
